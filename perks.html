<h2>The basics of perks</h2>

<p>There are so many perks in dead by daylight can help both sides massively in their own ways. The goal to go for is to synergize your perks so that they can work together to make
you stronger while playing. It is more tricky on the hunter becasue since each hunter has their own unique traits and powers. You want to match your perks up with their abilitys.
One last thing. In the game there are hex totems mentioned earlier. Hunters can use those totems to get special perks in their slots that are very helpful. You will see "Hex:" next to the perks names
and thats how you know its a hex perk that you are using. Keep in mind that survivors can cleanse these totems and render your perk completly usless. </p>

<h2><span class="fixing">Teachable Perks</h2>

<p>For each survivor and hunter. They come with three perks pertaining to them. After you reach a certain level, you can find teachable perks in the bloodweb. After obtaining it, say if you got one from a survivor. Every survivor will now have that perk.
Same applies to the hunter.</p>

<h2><span class="fixing">Synergizing perks</h2>

<p>For those who dont know what this is. Synergizing perks is combing two or more perks to make your build stronger (A build is just your loadout of perks that you prefer to use).</p>

<p>Here is a list of examples for <span class = "hunter">The Hunter</span> side I have research and/or came up with myself that can help the listed hunters...</p>

<table border="2">
  <th><span class = "hunter">The Legion</span></th>
    <td><span class = "perks">Hex:Ruin</span> - Takes away survivors progress on generators overtime so that you can get into chases quicker instead of wasting time kicking the generators.</td>
    <td><span class = "perks">Discordance</span> - A generator will appear yellow and give you an alert if 2 or more surviors are on the generator. Helpful to prevent gen rushing and give information to where the survivors are.</td>
    <td><span class = "perks">A Nurse's Calling</span> - Can see the aura of survivors that are healing. Since you will be injuring alot with Legion. People are going to heal more and you'll be able to track them down easily.</td>
    <td><span class = "perks">Barbecue & Chili</span> - Each time you hook a survivor, you can see survivors aura's 40 meters from the hook. This can give you alot of information and legion is a fast hunter. So you'll be able to chase Survivors faster</td>
    <br>
  </table>
  <table border="2">
  <th><span class = "hunter">Trapper</span></th>
    <td><span class = "perks">Corrupt Intervention</span> - Blocks the far 3 generators from you. Forcing survivors to come to you and can allow time for you to set up traps.</td>
    <td><span class = "perks">Save the best for Last</span> - Each time you dont hit your obsession, you gain a token that will allow your cooldown after hitting a survivor to be shorter. Making chases quicker.
    (pro tip - If your obsession is caught in a bear trap, you will not lose a token.)</td>
    <td><span class = "perks">Chilling Tremors</span> - Each time you pick up a downed survivor. All the generators around the map will be blocked for 16 seconds. If a survivor is working on a gen. It will not block it and it can give useful information to the hunter.</td>
    <td><span class = "perks">Pop Goes the Weasel</span> - Each time you hook a survivor, this perk will activate. When you kick a generator, it will immediately regress 25% of the generator and continue to regress unless worked on by a survivor.</td>
    <br>
  </table>
