<h2>The basics</h2>

<p>On the hunters side, there is only you. You alone have to take on 4 survivors and prevent them from escaping. </p>


<h3>The objective</span></h3>
<p>The sole objective of the hunter is to keep all the generators dead and hunt the survivors by any means necessary.</p>

<h3>Powers</span></h3>

<p>Each hunter has their own unique power. All of them have the common theme of slowing down survivors in their own way. Here are a few examples...</p>
<br>

<table border="1">
  <tr>
  <td>Legion</td>
  <td>Trapper</td>
  <td>Huntress</td>
  <td>Wraith</td>
  <td>Plauge</td>
  <td>Add-ons</td>
  <tr>
    <td>Able to hit survivors and apply deep wound status effect to slow them down.</td>
    <td>Can place bear traps around the map and catch survivors. Stopping them dead in their tracks.</td>
    <td>Throws hatchets from afar, able to wound survivors.</td>
    <td>He can cloak and be invisible to the naked eye, however he is not able to attack. He can get out of it and get a speed boost to attack.</td>
    <td>She can throw up on object, survivors, or anything interactive and can make survivors sick.</td>
    <td>There are alot of them. The add-ons can boost the powers in their own way. All of the items and add ons can be obtained from the bloodweb.</td>
  </tr>
