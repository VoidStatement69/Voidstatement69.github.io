<summary>The Map</summary>
<p>In each trial, a map will be chosen at random for you to play in. Unless someone brings a map offering to chose the map.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Generators</summary>
<p>Around the map there are a total of 7 generators and you only need to do 5 of them to escape. The hunter can regress the progress made on these generators by kicking them or using certain perks to help
them like hex:ruin or pop goes the weasel. Survivors can speed up the progress by using toolboxes, perks, or extra help from other survivors.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Pallets and looping</summary>
<p>Around the map there are pallets that are stood up for survivors to drop. Survivors can use these pallets to loop around and waste the hunters time by chasing them. If the hunter gets to close to the survivor
while they are dropping the pallet, they are stunned for a couple of seconds unless they are running the perk Enduring which can make the stun time less.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Windows</summary>
<p>Around the map there are windows in building and walls that both the survivors and hunter can go through. Survivors can go through them faster than hunters, making them a good escape from the hunter for
alittle bit. However, after the survivor has gone through the same window three times in a row while in a chase. The window is blocked off and they can no longer go through the window. The hunter can go through
the window as many times as they want.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Scratch marks and being injured</summary>
<p>When a survivor starts to run, they will start to leave scratch marks that the hunter can follow to their position. They will disappear within 10 seconds, unless they are running the perk lightweight which
  make the scratch marks disappear 3 seconds faster. When you are struck by the hunter, you will start to bleed and have blood pools left behind until you are healed by another teammate or healing yourself
  with a medkit or the perk self-care. </p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Lockers</summary>
<p>Around the map you can find lockers to hide in as survivor. Once you enter these lockers you are applied the blindness affect and open to being grabbed by the hunter resulting in a instant down. However,
  entering a locker can hide your aura. It can be very helpful to avoid being spotted from a distance. (Side note: Lockers are also where huntress can grab her hatchets.) </p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Exit gates</summary>
<p>When all 5 generators are done. The exit gates will be powered up for the survivors to escape. It takes the survivors 16 seconds to open the exit gates and leave the trial. Unless the hunter is running
the perk Remember me which can make the gates longer to open. (Side note: If the exit gates are almost open and you want to get the match done as the hunter. You can smack the exit gate to open it
automatically and let the survivors out to move onto the next match.)</p>
